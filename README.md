Provision an simple Azure Windows 10 VM with all necessary components for remote RDP access using username and password.

#### Resources Provisioned

* Resource Group
* Virtual Network, Subnet, Network Security Group
* Microsoft Windows 10 VM

### Prerequisites

* [Download and Install Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html)


### Installing

* Populate admin_username and admin_password inside vars.tf with appropriate values which will be used to log into the instance

The [terraform init](https://www.terraform.io/docs/commands/init.html) command is used to initialize a working directory containing Terraform configuration files. This is the first command that should be run after writing a new Terraform configuration or cloning an existing one from version control. It is safe to run this command multiple times

```
terraform init
```

The [terraform plan](https://www.terraform.io/docs/commands/plan.html) command is used to create an execution plan. Terraform performs a refresh, unless explicitly disabled, and then determines what actions are necessary to achieve the desired state specified in the configuration files. This command is a convenient way to check whether the execution plan for a set of changes matches your expectations without making any changes to real resources or to the state. For example, terraform plan might be run before committing a change to version control, to create confidence that it will behave as expected.

```
terraform plan
```

The [terraform apply](https://www.terraform.io/docs/commands/apply.html) command is used to apply the changes required to reach the desired state of the configuration, or the pre-determined set of actions generated by a terraform plan execution plan.

```
terraform apply
```

### Removing

The [terraform destroy](https://www.terraform.io/docs/commands/destroy.html) command is used to destroy the Terraform-managed infrastructure.

```
terraform destroy
```
